# Student-Survey-Project

Overview:- This project involves analyzing student spending patterns in various retail stores across the United States using the "Student Survey" dataset. The primary goal is to create a comprehensive Power BI report that provides meaningful insights into student purchases across different categories such as video games, indoor games, toys, books, and gadgets. The report utilizes various visualizations and Power BI features to present the data effectively.

Key Tasks:-

1. Tabular Visualization:-

A. Created a tabular visualization to display the Total Amount of Purchase (TAP) based on 'Store location' and 'Store setting.'

B. Applied conditional formatting:-

a. Red for TAP between 0 and 35,000    b. Yellow for TAP between 35,000 and 60,000    c. Blue for TAP above 60,000

2. Matrix Visualization:-

A. Developed a matrix visualization to show the amount spent on outdoor sports across different ages and store settings.

B. Applied color formatting for the total amount spent on outdoor sports.

3. Funnel Chart:- Created a funnel chart to visualize the Total Amount of Purchase by 'Store setting,' displaying data labels as a percentage of the first value.

4. Pie Chart:- Designed a pie chart to show the total amount of purchase by different 'Store locations' specifically for the suburban store setting using filter context.

5. Scatter and Sand Dance Plots:-

A. Developed a scatter plot to analyze video game purchases and outdoor sports spending across different ages.

B. Created a sand dance plot to visualize spending on indoor sports and video games across different age groups.

6. Data Access Restriction:- Implemented data access restrictions based on user roles defined in a user mapping table, ensuring that users like "Mani" can only view data relevant to specific areas (e.g., Rural).

7. Power BI Cloud Service:

A. Published the report on Power BI cloud service and designed a master dashboard featuring funnel charts and scatter plots.

B. Set up a scheduled refresh for the dashboard six times a day, every four hours.

8. Power BI Q&A Feature:- Utilized the Q&A feature to:-

A. Show the average age of students.

B. Create a donut chart for the total amount of purchases by 'Store location.'
